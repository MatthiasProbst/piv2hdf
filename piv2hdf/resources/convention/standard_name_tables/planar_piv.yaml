  flag:
    description: A flag indicates the processing status of a vector. It can be disabled,
      active or processed in any other way by a post-processing step. The flag meaning
      must be provided with the dataset. Recommendation for the flag meaning are 0-inactive,
      1-active, 2-masked, 4-no result, 8-disabled, 16-filtered, 32-interpolated, 64-replaced,
